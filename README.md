### Hi there, I'm [Your Name] 👋

I am an **M.Tech Research Scholar in Manufacturing Engineering**, specializing in the numerical modeling of solid-state joining processes. My work bridges the gap between theoretical mechanics and computational simulation.

🔭 **Current Focus**
I am developing Python-based analytical models to predict heat generation and temperature distribution in **Friction Stir Welding (FSW)** of Dissimilar Materials (Cu-Al systems).

🛠 **Technical Stack**
* **Languages:** Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)
* **Simulation:** ANSYS Mechanical (APDL)
* **Manufacturing:** Parameter Optimization
* **Data Analysis:** Design of Experiments (DOE), Statistical Hypothesis Testing

📫 **Looking for PhD Opportunities (2026)**
I am seeking doctoral research positions focused on **Digital Manufacturing, Process Modelling, or Solid Mechanics**.
